Function pitch_shift Shift the pitch of a batch of waveforms by a given amount. Methods pitch_shift Shift the pitch of a batch of waveforms by a given amount. Arguments Argument Required Default Value Type Description input Yes torch.Tensor [ shape=( batch_size, channels, samples ) ] Input audio clips of shape (batch_size, channels, samples) shift Yes float OR Fraction Inputs of type float indicate the amount to pitch-shift in # of bins (where 1 bin == 1 semitone if bins_per_octave == 12). Inputs of type Fraction indicate a pitch-shift ratio (usually an element in get_fast_shifts() ). sample_rate Yes int The sample rate of the input audio clips. n_fft No 256 int Size of FFT. Default 256. Smaller is faster. bins_per_octave No 12 int Number of bins per octave. Default is 12. Return value Type Description torch.Tensor [ shape=( batch_size, channels, samples ) ] The pitch-shifted batch of audio clips get_fast_shifts Search for pitch-shift targets that can be computed quickly for a given sample rate. Argument Required Default Value Type Description sample_rate Yes int The sample rate of an audio clip. condition No lambda x: ( x >= 0.5 and x <= 2 and x != 1 ) Callable A function to validate fast shift ratios. Default value limits computed targets to values between -1 and +1 octaves.
