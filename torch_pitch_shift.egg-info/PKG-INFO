        ## About
        
        This package includes two main features:
        * Pitch-shift audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
        * Calculate efficient pitch-shift targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise pitch-shifts)
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install torch_pitch_shift
        ```
