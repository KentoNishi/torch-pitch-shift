# Torch Pitch Shift Docs

Welcome to the `torch-pitch-shift` documentation!

[View on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/torch-pitch-shift/) / [View on GitHub](https://github.com/torch-pitch-shift)

## What is `torch-pitch-shift`?

*Pitch-shift audio clips quickly with PyTorch (CUDA supported)! Additional utilities for searching efficient transformations are included.*

This package includes two main features:

* Pitch-shift audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
* Calculate efficient pitch-shift targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise pitch-shifts)
