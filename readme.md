## About

This package includes two main features:
* Pitch-shift audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
* Calculate efficient pitch-shift targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise pitch-shifts)

## Installation
```bash
pip install torch_pitch_shift
```

## Usage
